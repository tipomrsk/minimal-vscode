# Minimal-VSCode

These are my VSCode configurations to keep the interface as minimal as possible. I use a lot of shortcuts and remove many elements from the screen, which can also help speed up workflows.

## Fonts

At the moment, Iâ€™m using MonoLisa, but here are my options and suggestions:
1. MonoLisa
2. JetBrains Mono
3. DankMono

## Extension

The following extension is required:

[Apc Customize UI++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drcika.apc-extension)

## Themes

For color themes, here are some suggestions:

1. [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme)
2. [GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)
